  \textit{Notes:} Effect of parity requirement on whether individual's ex ante project correspond to RAPID project choice.
  The 'fine measure' is a disaggregation of project sector.
  We report sample average treatment effects. Regressions use block fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the village cluster level. Includes only villages where RAPID was implemented.  $* p \le 0.10, ** p \le 0.05, *** p \le  0.01$.}
