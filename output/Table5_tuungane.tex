  We report sample average treatment effects. Regressions use block fixed effects. Standard errors clustered at the village cluster level. Based on implementing partner's project data and includes villages that were
  and were not surveyed by the research teams.  $* p \le 0.10, ** p \le 0.05, *** p \le  0.01$.}
